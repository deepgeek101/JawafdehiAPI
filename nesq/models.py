"""
Models for the NES Queue System (NESQ).

The NESQ system provides a queue-based workflow for updating the Nepal Entity
Service (NES) database. Authenticated contributors submit change requests via
a REST API, which are reviewed by admins/moderators and then processed by a
daily cron job that commits approved changes to the nes-db repository.

See .kiro/specs/nes-queue-system/ for full specification.
